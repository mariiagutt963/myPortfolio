                The main concept behind this project was to work with three visual effects â€” layering, sharp geometric edges, and the effect of screen printing. The latter was intended to contrast with the hardness and inorganic nature of the first two. We also aimed to apply these effects functionally, for example in elements such as internal content structure, chapter marking, and similar components. Since this was a literary magazine, we wanted to preserve a sense of artistic character.
                <br /><br />
                We tried to achieve that through a muted, narrow color palette as well as by using a relatively simple compositional structure with dominant elements of black-and-white screen-printed photography. We also created a distinct vintage aesthetic.
